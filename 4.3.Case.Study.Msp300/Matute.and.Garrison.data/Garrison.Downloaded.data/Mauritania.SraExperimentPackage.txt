Adults were aged 4-5 days then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at _80¡ C. Total RNA was isolated from whole tissue using the RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per manufacturerÕs recommendations. RNA concentration was determined with the NanopDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE) and RNA quality was assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit V2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used for next generation sequencing library construction per manufacturerÕs protocols. Briefly, polyA mRNA was purified from ~100 ng total RNA with oligo-dT magnetic beads and fragmented. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with random hexamer priming followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis. End repair and 3' adenylation was performed on the double stranded cDNA. Illumina indexed adaptors were ligated to both ends of the cDNA, purified by gel electrophoresis and amplified with PCR primers specific to the adaptor sequences to generate amplicons of approximately 200 to 500 bp in size. The amplified libraries were purified by AMPure (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) purification and hybridized to an Illumina pair end flow cell for cluster amplification using the cBot (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at a concentration of 8 picomoles per lane."	260	260	0	0		PolyA	TRANSCRIPTOMIC	RNA-Seq	SRS691300	BioSample	SAMN02999517	SRS691300	1	1	Application Read	0	0	Forward	200	200	SRX688784	Illumina HiSeq 2500					SRP012053	BioProject	PRJNA158675	SRP012053	Drosophila mauritiana mau12w male RNAseq	center	dgarriga@bio.rochester.edu	585-276-4816	Daniel	Garrigan			University of Rochester	SRS691300	5588184451	5588184451		Drosophila mauritiana	Drosophila mauritiana mau12w male whole body PE RNA library		28189592	28189592	7226	7226	BioSample	SAMN02999517	SRS691300																																																																																			SRP012053	Simclade	University of Rochester	Drosophila mauritiana	"The species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup are important models for studying the molecular basis of the origin of species.

Adults were aged 4-5 days then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at _80¡ C. Total RNA was isolated from whole tissue using the RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per manufacturerÕs recommendations. RNA concentration was determined with the NanopDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE) and RNA quality was assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit V2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used for next generation sequencing library construction per manufacturerÕs protocols. Briefly, polyA mRNA was purified from ~100 ng total RNA with oligo-dT magnetic beads and fragmented. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with random hexamer priming followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis. End repair and 3' adenylation was performed on the double stranded cDNA. Illumina indexed adaptors were ligated to both ends of the cDNA, purified by gel electrophoresis and amplified with PCR primers specific to the adaptor sequences to generate amplicons of approximately 200 to 500 bp in size. The amplified libraries were purified by AMPure (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) purification and hybridized to an Illumina pair end flow cell for cluster amplification using the cBot (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at a concentration of 8 picomoles per lane."	260	260	0	0		PolyA	TRANSCRIPTOMIC	RNA-Seq	SRS691299			SRS691299	1	1	Application Read	0	0	Forward	200	200	SRX688739	Illumina HiSeq 2500					SRP012053			SRP012053	Drosophila mauritiana mau12w female RNAseq	center	dgarriga@bio.rochester.edu	585-276-4816	Daniel	Garrigan			University of Rochester	SRS691299	7702101501	7702101501		Drosophila mauritiana	Drosophila mauritiana mau12w female whole body PE RNA library		38873929	38873929	7226	7226	BioSample	SAMN02999516	SRS691299																																																																																			SRP012053	Simclade	University of Rochester	Drosophila mauritiana	"The species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup are important models for studying the molecular basis of the origin of species.

3	SRX688712	R8	University of Rochester	"Genomic DNA was extracted from 15 female flies using a modified Puregene DNA Extraction Protocol. The 15 frozen female flies for each library were lysed by 300 mL cold Cell Lysis Solution (Qiagen, 158906) with pestle homogenization and incubation at room temperature for 15 min, and treated with 4.5 mL RNase A at 37¡C for 15 min. Proteins were precipitated out with 100 mL Protein Precipitation Solution (Qiagen, 158910) and centrifugation at 16,000g for 4 min. gDNA in supernatant was purified by DNA Clean and Concentrator Ð25 Kit (Zymo, D4005) with five volumes of binding buffer to sample. The quality of all gDNA samples was checked by running on an agarose gel, and the concentration was measured with a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen).

5	SRX688612	R56	University of Rochester	"Genomic DNA was extracted from 15 female flies using a modified Puregene DNA Extraction Protocol. The 15 frozen female flies for each library were lysed by 300 mL cold Cell Lysis Solution (Qiagen, 158906) with pestle homogenization and incubation at room temperature for 15 min, and treated with 4.5 mL RNase A at 37¡C for 15 min.

The quality of all gDNA samples was checked by running on an agarose gel, and the concentration was measured with a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). For the library preparations, 3 mg gDNA was sheared to 300 bp with Covaris, followed with end-repairing, A-tailing, ligating to adaptors, selecting size between 350 and 450 bp with 2% agarose gel, and PCR amplifying for 15 cycles.

The 15 frozen female flies for each library were lysed by 300 mL cold Cell Lysis Solution (Qiagen, 158906) with pestle homogenization and incubation at room temperature for 15 min, and treated with 4.5 mL RNase A at 37¡C for 15 min. Proteins were precipitated out with 100 mL Protein Precipitation Solution (Qiagen, 158910) and centrifugation at 16,000g for 4 min. gDNA in supernatant was purified by DNA Clean and Concentrator Ð25 Kit (Zymo, D4005) with five volumes of binding buffer to sample. The quality of all gDNA samples was checked by running on an agarose gel, and the concentration was measured with a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). For the library preparations, 3 mg gDNA was sheared to 300 bp with Covaris, followed with end-repairing, A-tailing, ligating to adaptors, selecting size between 350 and 450 bp with 2% agarose gel, and PCR amplifying for 15 cycles. The concentration of the sample was measured with Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen) and the libraries were diluted to a concentration of 10 nM for sequencing."	350	350	0	0		size fractionation	GENOMIC	WGS	SRS691158	BioSample	SAMN02999510	SRS691158	1	1	Application Read	0	0	Forward	152	152	SRX688588	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx					SRP012053	BioProject	PRJNA158675	SRP012053	Drosophila mauritiana R39 PE genomic DNA library	center	dgarriga@bio.rochester.edu	585-276-4816	Daniel	Garrigan			University of Rochester	SRS691158	15948269436	15948269436		Drosophila mauritiana	Drosophila mauritiana R39 PE genomic library		113671932	113671932	7226	7226	BioSample	SAMN02999510	SRS691158																																																																																			SRP012053	Simclade	University of Rochester	Drosophila mauritiana	"The species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup are important models for studying the molecular basis of the origin of species.

The 15 frozen female flies for each library were lysed by 300 mL cold Cell Lysis Solution (Qiagen, 158906) with pestle homogenization and incubation at room temperature for 15 min, and treated with 4.5 mL RNase A at 37¡C for 15 min. Proteins were precipitated out with 100 mL Protein Precipitation Solution (Qiagen, 158910) and centrifugation at 16,000g for 4 min. gDNA in supernatant was purified by DNA Clean and Concentrator Ð25 Kit (Zymo, D4005) with five volumes of binding buffer to sample. The quality of all gDNA samples was checked by running on an agarose gel, and the concentration was measured with a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). For the library preparations, 3 mg gDNA was sheared to 300 bp with Covaris, followed with end-repairing, A-tailing, ligating to adaptors, selecting size between 350 and 450 bp with 2% agarose gel, and PCR amplifying for 15 cycles. The concentration of the sample was measured with Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen) and the libraries were diluted to a concentration of 10 nM for sequencing."	350	350	0	0		size fractionation	GENOMIC	WGS	SRS691153	BioSample	SAMN02999509	SRS691153	1	1	Application Read	0	0	Forward	152	152	SRX688583	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx					SRP012053	BioProject	PRJNA158675	SRP012053	Drosophila mauritiana R32 PE genomic DNA library	center	dgarriga@bio.rochester.edu	585-276-4816	Daniel	Garrigan			University of Rochester	SRS691153	16794377924	16794377924		Drosophila mauritiana	Drosophila mauritiana R32 PE genomic library		121660322	121660322	7226	7226	BioSample	SAMN02999509	SRS691153																																																																																			SRP012053	Simclade	University of Rochester	Drosophila mauritiana	"The species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup are important models for studying the molecular basis of the origin of species.

The 15 frozen female flies for each library were lysed by 300 mL cold Cell Lysis Solution (Qiagen, 158906) with pestle homogenization and incubation at room temperature for 15 min, and treated with 4.5 mL RNase A at 37¡C for 15 min. Proteins were precipitated out with 100 mL Protein Precipitation Solution (Qiagen, 158910) and centrifugation at 16,000g for 4 min. gDNA in supernatant was purified by DNA Clean and Concentrator Ð25 Kit (Zymo, D4005) with five volumes of binding buffer to sample. The quality of all gDNA samples was checked by running on an agarose gel, and the concentration was measured with a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). For the library preparations, 3 mg gDNA was sheared to 300 bp with Covaris, followed with end-repairing, A-tailing, ligating to adaptors, selecting size between 350 and 450 bp with 2% agarose gel, and PCR amplifying for 15 cycles. The concentration of the sample was measured with Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen) and the libraries were diluted to a concentration of 10 nM for sequencing."	350		0			size fractionation	GENOMIC	WGS	SRS691153	BioSample	SAMN02999509	SRS691153	77	77	Application Read	1	1	Reverse	152		SRX688583	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx					SRP012053	BioProject	PRJNA158675	SRP012053	Drosophila mauritiana R32 PE genomic DNA library	center	dgarriga@bio.rochester.edu	585-276-4816	Daniel	Garrigan			University of Rochester	SRS691153	16794377924			Drosophila mauritiana	Drosophila mauritiana R32 PE genomic library		121660322		7226		BioSample	SAMN02999509	SRS691153																																																																																			SRP012053	Simclade	University of Rochester	Drosophila mauritiana	"The species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup are important models for studying the molecular basis of the origin of species.
